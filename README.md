# Accelerate data aggregation with Excel!
*A CDL workshop by Dr. Matthew Pastizzo, Department of Psychology, SUNY Geneseo* 

For those looking for a quick and accurate method for computing sums, averages, and percentages for spreadsheet data, we have an answer. In this workshop, we practice aggregating data (viz., Google form survey responses, Argos reports) in Excel using pivot tables. 

Pivot tables are so-named for the ability to turn or pivot the aggregated data, allowing us to examine the underlying data from different perspectives. Upon opening a raw data file (e.g., in a CSV format), an informative pivot table with aggregated data can be created in as few as 5 clicks allowing us to make sense of data sets (small and large) very quickly. 

We also explore creating slicers to filter pivot tables with as few as 3 additional clicks. Although we use Excel in this workshop, please note that a very similar method can be applied to data in Google Sheets.
